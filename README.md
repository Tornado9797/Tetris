# Tetris
This is a Game Maker port of Tetris that I never got around to finishing, retrieved April 4th, 2013 at 10:02:40 AM.

## Premise 
As the due dates of the main academic Game Maker projects were spread out rather wide, I had loads of down time. Among the few projects I made in my free time, this was one of them. 

## Usage
I did not get very far with this project; only very basic functionality exists. Use the arrow keys to move the tetris blocks, and spacebar to rotate. Only one type exists, and line clearing doesn't exist.
